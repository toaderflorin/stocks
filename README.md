## Time Breakdown
A total of aproximately 15 hours were needed to develop the demo application.

Initial setup (Node.js/Express/WebPack): 2h

Basic candlestick chart rendering with React: 3h

## Observations

The JavaScript code uses 2 white space chars for tab and leaves out trailing semicolons, thus following the standard Node.js guidlines Stock value data has been manually created and it's probably not very realistic. "Average" represents the average traded value for the stock during a particular day, it is not computed from open / close / min / max values.
