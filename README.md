# Vitamin Stocks Demo
Make sure you have Node 8.8.1 (Current) installed. Application can be run by typing:

*npm install* (to install packages needed by the app)

followed by:

*npm start*

at the command prompt in the folder containing the source code.

## Time Breakdown
A total of aproximately 15 hours were needed to develop the demo application.

Initial setup (Node.js/Express/WebPack): 2h

Basic candlestick chart rendering with React: 3h

Ability to render stock values for multiple companies: 1h

Zoom in functionality: 2h

Future value prediction for stock: 3h

Refactoring and cleanup: 4h

## Observations

The Javascript code uses 2 white space chars for tab and leaves out trailing semicolons, thus following the standard Node.js guidlines. Stock value data has been manually created and it's probably not very realistic. "Average" represents the average traded value for the stock during a particular day, it is not computed from open / close / min / max values.
